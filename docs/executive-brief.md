# Executive Brief — ClipCard

**Thesis.** ClipCard is an engineering control surface, not a checklist. It counters the physics behind organizational failures (ETTO, local minima, panic, drift) with small, blame-safe mechanisms applied **only** when risk is high.

**Mechanisms.** Authority Window, Two-Key + TTL (sunset), Kill Criteria (redlines → action), Dated Recheck with Steward, Trigger Rule (Impact×Uncertainty or red flags), Blame-Safe Policy, Evidence snapshots.

**Value.**
- **Containment:** bounded blast radius and pre-agreed rollback.
- **Due diligence:** auditable, dual-approved high-risk decisions.
- **Reliable sensing:** protected near-miss reporting.
- **Velocity over time:** fewer reversions and rollbacks.

**Proof to track.** On-time rechecks (≥80%), near-miss capture (↑), false approvals/reversions/incidents (↓), plus domain metrics (CFR/MTTR, appeals, AAR).

**Adopt.** Use only for high-risk work; enforce TTL reviews; protect stewards; publish Field Reports.
